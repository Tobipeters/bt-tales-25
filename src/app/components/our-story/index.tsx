              <h3>First Met</h3>
              <p>
                Our paths crossed in the most unexpected way, and from that very
                first moment, I knew there was something different about her.
                There was a spark—gentle, undeniable, and somehow familiar. I
                wasn&apos;t entirely sure where it would lead, but deep down, I knew
                she was someone I didn&apos;t want to let go of. <br /> <br /> Yes,
                true, true. For me, it began as a simple friendship—laughter
                shared, long conversations, and a comfort that felt like home.
                Slowly, without us even realizing, that friendship blossomed
                into the most beautiful love story. And now, that story is
                unfolding into a lifelong union we both prayed for.

              <h3>Fell in Love</h3>
              <p>
                Through long walks and unhurried conversations, friendship
                quietly deepened into something more. With every step and every
                word, I found myself drawn to her - her laughter, her kindness,
                and the way she made even the simplest moments feel
                unforgettable.
                <br />
                <br />
                And for me, it was in those same moments - the talks that never
                seemed to end, the ease of being with him - that I realized
                friendship had blossomed into love. With him, everything felt
                light, natural, and certain, as though our hearts had always
                been waiting to meet.

              <h3>The Proposal</h3>

                I wanted our story to take its next step surrounded by the
                people who mean the most to us. So, I gathered our closest
                friends and family, put together a solid deck (yes, a pitch,
                because why not?), and gave the best presentation of my life.
                Somewhere between promising her a lifetime of covering,
                adventure and a steady supply of ice cream, I asked her to spend
                forever with me. And… she said YES.
                <br />
                <br />
                Lol. No words oh. Yes I said YES!🤭
